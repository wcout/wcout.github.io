<h1>FLTK Sunrise demo</h1>

<p><code>v1.0: 2017/03/05</code></p>

<p><em>“A non-scientific but rather artistic astronomical demo
of sunrise, stars, milky way and sparks - coded in the
principle of mimimalism and stopped enhancing before it
got messy...”</em></p>

<p>I wrote this demo within a few hours, after having been inspired
to it by watching a beautiful sunset recently. I wanted to
experiment with the magic melting of colors involved when night
turns to day and vice versa.</p>

<p>I added a few "details" to it after having finished the outline.
Especially nice I find how the clouds worked out, as hords
of small alpha blocks grouped together in the form of a cloud.</p>
