<h1>FLTK Gomoku</h1>

<p><em>A minimal implementation of the "5 in a row" game.</em></p>

<p><code>v1.0  15/12/2017</code></p>

<p><img src="screenshots/fltk-gomoku-wins.png" alt="Screenshot of FLTK Gomoku (with custom background)" title="Screenshot of FLTK Gomoku (with custom background)" /></p>

<p>Requires <code>FLTK 1.3</code> or above.</p>

<p>Set pieces alternately (against the computer) on a
19x19 grid board.</p>

<p>The first one to get <em>exactly</em> (means: not more than) five pieces
in a row of any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
wins the game.</p>

<p>This program currently offers only a very simple move
algorithm without levels. Nevertheless it doesn't
play too bad...</p>

<p>It features a resizable graphical board with an optional
background (tiled) image (if supplied as <code>bg.gif</code> in the
current directory) and pieces drawn from SVG images (needs <code>FLTK 1.4</code>!).</p>

<p>For cheating moves can be undone  with the <code>BackSpace</code> key.</p>
